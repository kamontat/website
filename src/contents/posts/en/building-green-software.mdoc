As sustainability becomes a core business objective, software engineers are rethinking how code interacts with hardware and energy consumption. Green software focuses on reducing carbon emissions by optimising algorithms, minimising data transfer and leveraging renewable‑powered infrastructure. Simple choices — such as using efficient data structures or scheduling compute tasks during off‑peak renewable generation — can lead to substantial savings.

Measuring the environmental impact of software requires new metrics. The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification offers a way to quantify emissions across development, deployment and usage. By embracing this mindset, we not only reduce our ecological footprint but also reduce costs in Thai Baht as energy prices fluctuate.

Saving watts and bytes can be as satisfying as squashing bugs — and less likely to cause headaches. Turning off unused servers is like turning off the lights when leaving a room; your mother would approve.
