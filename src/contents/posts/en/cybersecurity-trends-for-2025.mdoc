As digital threats evolve, cybersecurity strategies must adapt accordingly. In 2025, we anticipate increased adoption of zero‑trust architectures, wider use of multi‑factor authentication and continued growth in ransomware attacks. Security teams will leverage artificial intelligence to detect anomalies in network traffic, but attackers will also employ AI to craft more convincing phishing campaigns.

With the rollout of 5G and expansion of IoT, attack surfaces multiply. Organisations should invest in security awareness training and incident response playbooks. Budgeting for cybersecurity should be viewed as an investment rather than a cost — a data breach can easily exceed tens of millions of Thai Baht when factoring fines, remediation and reputational damage.
