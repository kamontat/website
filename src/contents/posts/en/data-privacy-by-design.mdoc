Privacy cannot be an afterthought. Data privacy by design embeds protection measures into products from the outset. This includes collecting only necessary data, anonymising sensitive fields and using encryption both at rest and in transit. Regulatory frameworks like GDPR and Thailand’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) mandate these practices, but ethical considerations go further.

Engineers should conduct regular threat modelling and keep user control at the centre of design. A well‑considered consent flow, clear privacy notices and robust access controls build trust. Investing time upfront reduces the likelihood of costly breaches and fines — penalties under PDPA can reach up to THB 5 million for serious violations.
