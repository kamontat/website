Artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept but a practical tool for improving operational efficiency. In a factory, AI algorithms can optimise production schedules, reducing downtime and energy consumption by 10 % and saving thousands of Thai Baht on electricity each month. In software teams, machine‑learning models can analyse logs to predict failures before they occur.

Efficiency isn’t just about automation; it’s about understanding where to apply AI for maximum impact. Metrics such as mean time to recovery (MTTR) and throughput can highlight bottlenecks. Deploying AI responsibly requires clear objectives, high‑quality data and a willingness to iterate.

You can edit this page in the [Admin UI](/keystatic/collection/posts/item/harnessing-ai-for-operational-efficiency), or directly in your IDE at `en/harnessing-ai-for-operational-efficiency.mdoc`. Look forward to your contributions; after all, even algorithms need a periodic review. And remember: AI may be smart, but it still can’t make coffee — yet.
