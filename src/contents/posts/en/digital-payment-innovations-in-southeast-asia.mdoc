Southeast Asia has become a hotbed for digital payment innovation. E‑wallets, QR‑based payments and instant transfer platforms are rapidly replacing cash, driven by young, mobile‑first populations and supportive regulatory frameworks. Thailand’s PromptPay system, for example, allows instant transactions using national ID numbers or phone numbers, and has processed billions of baht since launch.

Start‑ups and established banks are experimenting with blockchain to reduce remittance fees and enable cross‑border payments. A notable trend is the integration of loyalty programmes and micro‑insurance into payment apps, blurring the lines between finance and lifestyle. Companies that can offer seamless, secure and low‑cost transactions will dominate this competitive space.
