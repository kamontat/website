Edge computing brings computational power closer to the sensors and devices generating data, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. For IoT applications in manufacturing, agriculture or smart homes, processing at the edge means decisions can be made in milliseconds. This responsiveness is essential for autonomous vehicles and industrial robots where delays can be costly or dangerous.

By distributing workloads across the network, we reduce the reliance on centralised data centres and improve resilience. The challenge lies in securing these edge nodes and ensuring consistent updates across potentially thousands of devices. Standardising protocols and investing in robust monitoring are key.

You can edit this page in the [Admin UI](/keystatic/collection/posts/item/edge-computing-and-the-internet-of-things), or directly in your IDE at `en/edge-computing-and-the-internet-of-things.mdoc`. The edge might be rugged, but your feedback will help smooth the path â€” just like a Thai street vendor who keeps ingredients close at hand.
