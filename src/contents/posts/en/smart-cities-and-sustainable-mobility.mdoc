Smart cities leverage data and technology to improve urban life. From intelligent traffic lights that reduce congestion to sensors that monitor air quality, these systems can make our cities more liveable. Sustainable mobility is a core component, encompassing electric vehicles, shared mobility services and well‑designed public transit. In Bangkok, for example, adding dedicated bus lanes and optimising traffic signals could save commuters hours every week and reduce emissions.

Implementing smart city projects requires coordination between government, private sector and citizens. Transparent data governance and privacy protections are essential. Investment in infrastructure pays dividends: a study by the Asian Development Bank suggests that every Thai Baht invested in urban transport generates up to three times that amount in economic benefits.

After all, there’s nothing smarter than a city that works for its people — except maybe a lamp post that jokes about traffic.
